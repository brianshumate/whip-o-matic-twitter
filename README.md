# whip-o-matic Twitter Bot

##  Installation & Operation

Please don't install and operate this bot directly as it is mine. Instead,
modify both the code and data in `var` to make your own creation.

The `bot.js` in `lib` is a modified version of an example included as part
of the [Twit project](https://github.com/ttezel/twit) and used in compliance
with that project's license.

OFFICIAL SHOUT OUT AND MAD PROPS TO TOLGA TEZEL (@ttezel)!
